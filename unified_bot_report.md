## Comparative Analysis

The top three bots, "candle master" (with two entries reflecting different data sets), and "algo link," showcase varying performance characteristics.  Both "candle master" instances exhibit strong live Sharpe ratios, suggesting robust risk-adjusted returns despite lower live average returns compared to backtests.  This discrepancy highlights the challenges of translating backtested performance to live market conditions. "Algo link," similarly, shows a higher live Sharpe ratio than its backtest, indicating improved risk management in live trading. However, "algo link" experienced a significantly lower number of live trades compared to its backtest, suggesting a potential difference in trading frequency or strategy implementation. While all three demonstrate the importance of evaluating live performance metrics alongside backtest data, "candle master" and "algo link" highlight the need for further investigation into the reasons for deviations between backtested and live trading results.


## Individual Bot Analysis

### 1. candle master

The crypto bot "candle master"  demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest, spanning 1230 days, yielded an impressive 385.1% return despite a 74.74% market increase, the live performance over 235 days resulted in a more modest 117.41% return against a 20.86% market decline.  This difference highlights the challenges of translating backtest results to real-world conditions.  Both live and backtest data show a relatively low win rate (around 49%), but a healthy profit/loss ratio above 1.4, suggesting that winning trades significantly outweigh losing trades.  The bot utilizes a fixed portfolio across ten major cryptocurrency pairs (BTC, BNB, ETH, ADA, TRX, LTC, LINK, DOT, ATOM, SOL), executing a mean of one entry per trade.  Live quarterly reports reveal that while the overall return is positive, profitability varied considerably across quarters, highlighting potential volatility in its strategy. The high Calmar ratios (15.7 live, 4.31 backtest) indicate a reasonable risk-adjusted return, though a substantial worst expected drawdown is noted in both scenarios.


### 2. candle master

The "candle master" bot demonstrates a significant difference between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest shows a substantial 385.1% return over 1230 days, incorporating 2634 trades with a 45.9% win rate and a profit/loss ratio of 1.40,  live performance reveals a more moderate 58.35% return over 143 days with 247 trades and a 47.4% win rate, resulting in a higher profit/loss ratio of 1.55.  Despite the lower live return, the bot exhibits strong risk-adjusted performance metrics in live trading, boasting a Sharpe Ratio of 2.47 and a Calmar Ratio of 17.21, significantly surpassing its backtest counterparts (Sharpe Ratio 1.63 and Calmar Ratio 4.31). This suggests the bot's live strategy is more robust in managing risk, even if less aggressive in generating returns compared to its backtested potential. The bot trades across a diverse portfolio of 10 crypto pairs and typically holds positions for approximately 19 hours.  Further analysis of the quarterly reports will be needed to understand the reasons for the variance between live and backtest results.


### 3. algo link

The `algo link` bot demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 489.3% return over 1100 days, with a considerable number of trades (247), the live performance yielded a more modest 57.51% return over 141 days, involving only 23 trades.  Despite the lower live return, the live bot exhibits a higher Sharpe ratio (2.66 vs 1.21) and Calmar ratio (14.36 vs 2.09), suggesting potentially better risk-adjusted returns in live trading. The live bot's win rate (65.22%) is slightly lower than the backtest (68.02%), but its profit/loss ratio (2.55) is considerably higher than the backtest (1.64). This indicates that while fewer trades were executed live, those trades were more profitable on average.  The bot focuses on the LINK/USDT pair and, based on its 30-day return distribution, has a high probability (73.21%) of generating positive returns in live trading, although the maximum possible return is significantly lower live than in the backtest.  The differences highlight the inherent challenges in translating backtest results into live market conditions.


### 4. Ethovate

Ethovate is a crypto bot trading ETH/USDT that exhibits contrasting performance characteristics between its live and backtest data.  While the backtest, spanning nearly two years (729 days), showed a 7% return despite a significant market change of 180.61%, the live performance over 58 days yielded a more modest 2.54% return against a 46.59% market movement. This discrepancy suggests potential overfitting in the backtest, evidenced by a lower Sharpe Ratio (0.05 vs 0.53) and Calmar Ratio (0.17 vs 1.29) in the backtest compared to live trading.  Live trading shows a higher win rate (63.56% vs 56.03%) and a slightly better profit/loss ratio (1.11 vs 1.03), but also a significantly lower maximum drawdown (-13.04% vs -20.51%). The live bot expectation model predicts a 30-day average return of 7.79%, suggesting that the short live trading period may not fully reflect the bot's potential. The differences highlight the challenges of translating backtested results to real-world market conditions and the need for ongoing monitoring and adjustments.


### 5. Fortune Flow

The Fortune Flow bot demonstrates a notable discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 603.4% return over 1100 days,  the live performance yielded a more modest 24.74% return over 142 days.  Despite this difference, key characteristics remain consistent: a win rate hovering around 55%, a Profit/Loss ratio above 1.4, and Sharpe and Calmar ratios indicating relatively good risk-adjusted returns (1.76 and 6.01 respectively for live, and 2.09 and 5.45 for backtest).  The live bot's 30-day returns distribution suggests a 69% probability of a positive return, with an expected average return of 6.18%.  The bot trades primarily in ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, LINK, SUI, PEPE, AVAX, and HBAR, executing 245 trades in its live run and significantly more (1839) during backtesting. This difference highlights the challenges of translating backtest results to real-market conditions and suggests a need for further analysis to reconcile the performance gap.


### 6. king damoon 

The crypto bot "king damoon" demonstrates contrasting performance characteristics between its live and backtest runs.  While the live performance shows a modest 8.09% return over 54 days with a remarkably high 100% win rate across only 6 trades, the backtest reveals a significantly higher 37.99% return over 167 days, albeit with a more typical 72.92% win rate from 48 trades. This discrepancy highlights potential overfitting or limitations in the live trading environment. The backtest also experienced a maximum drawdown of -10.37%, unlike the live run's flawless performance.  The live bot's expectation model predicts a high probability (100%) of positive returns within a 30-day period,  while the backtest expectation, based on a much larger dataset, shows a more conservative 73.91% probability of positive returns, hinting at a potentially more realistic assessment of risk. The significantly longer average position duration in the backtest (1 day) compared to the live run (0 days 11:35:00) suggests a difference in trading strategy execution or market conditions.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the differences and improve live performance to match the backtesting results.


### 7. Gain Master

The Gain Master bot demonstrates a strong live performance with a 41.5% return over 295 days, exceeding the market change of 96.55%.  This is achieved with a high win rate (83.08%) and favorable profit/loss ratio (3.53).  However, backtesting data reveals a significantly higher return of 56.27% over 730 days, despite a negative market change (-33.07%), suggesting potential overfitting or market-specific factors influencing live performance.  While the live bot's Sharpe Ratio (2.82) and Calmar Ratio (12.45) indicate robust risk-adjusted returns, these metrics are lower in the backtest (0.96 and 1.51, respectively), highlighting a disparity between simulated and real-world results.  The bot utilizes a live portfolio mode with equal allocation across 10 crypto pairs, executing 201 trades in the live period and 466 in the backtest. The average position duration is relatively short, approximately 14 hours live and 13 hours during backtesting.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile the performance discrepancies and determine the bot's true robustness.


### 8. Band Master

The Band Master bot demonstrates a notable contrast between its live and backtest performances.  Live performance over 267 days yielded a substantial 48.99% return, significantly outperforming the market's 53.8% change, with a robust Sharpe ratio of 1.97 and Calmar ratio of 4.44. This strong live performance is characterized by a high win rate (74.83%) and favorable profit/loss ratio (2.27) across 429 trades.  However, backtesting over 730 days showed a more modest 32.62% return, despite a significantly higher number of trades (2036), and considerably lower risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe ratio 0.43, Calmar ratio 0.5). The discrepancy suggests that Band Master's strategy may be particularly well-suited to the specific market conditions encountered during its live run. Further analysis is needed to identify the key drivers of this performance difference and evaluate its long-term sustainability.


### 9. AdaMooner

The AdaMooner bot demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 104 days yielded a 10.59% return, exceeding the market change of 15.12% by a small margin, the backtest over 1151 days showed a considerably higher return of 876.07%, despite a negative market change of -47.89%.  This suggests potential overfitting in the backtesting model or significant changes in market conditions affecting the bot's live trading strategy.  AdaMooner executes a relatively low number of trades (26 live, 378 backtest), with a consistent win rate above 60% in both live and backtest environments and a favorable profit/loss ratio.  The live bot expectation shows a high probability (80.26%) of positive returns within a 30-day period, although the expected average return is modest (3.66%).  Further investigation is required to reconcile the large disparity between live and backtested results and assess the bot's long-term viability and robustness.


### 10. Motive6

Motive6 demonstrates a significant divergence between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 270% return over 1100 days,  the live performance, spanning 105 days, yielded a more modest 16.06% return.  Despite this difference, both showcase a consistent positive win rate (64.79% live, 61.04% backtest) and favorable profit/loss ratios (2.06 live, 1.71 backtest).  However, the live bot's Sharpe Ratio (2.85) surpasses its backtested counterpart (1.43), suggesting better risk-adjusted returns in live trading.  The live bot's maximum drawdown (-5.87%) is considerably lower than the backtest (-22.02%), indicating improved resilience to market volatility.  Motive6 trades relatively frequently (71 live trades, 883 backtest trades) with an average position duration around one day. The discrepancy between live and backtest results warrants further investigation, but the live performance metrics, particularly the Sharpe Ratio and maximum drawdown, show promise for this bot's risk-adjusted performance.


### 11. Market Fryer

The Market Fryer bot demonstrates contrasting performance characteristics between its live and backtest data. While the live performance over 33 days yielded a modest 2.01% return, with a 60.32% win rate and a Sharpe ratio of 1.81,  its backtest over three years showed a significantly higher 92.19% return, albeit with a lower 67.74% win rate and a Sharpe ratio of 1.03. This discrepancy suggests potential differences in market conditions or strategy effectiveness between the backtested period and the live trading environment. The bot trades frequently (63 live trades, 4262 backtested trades), maintains a relatively short average position duration (around 5-6 hours), and exhibits a positive profit/loss ratio in both live and backtest scenarios.  The live bot expectation model suggests a high probability (100%) of a positive return within the next 30 days, ranging from 2.34% to 2.68%, while the backtest expectation is less certain.  The significant difference in maximum drawdown (-0.87% live vs. -15.72% backtest) highlights the inherent risk involved and the need for ongoing monitoring and potential adjustments to the trading strategy.


### 12. ADA Kicker

The ADA Kicker bot, ID , demonstrates a stark contrast between its live and backtest performance.  While its live performance over two days yielded a 5.36% return with a perfect 100% win rate across two trades,  its backtest spanning over three years shows a significantly higher 148.83% return, albeit with a 71% win rate and a maximum drawdown of -13.72%. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of translating backtested results to real-world trading conditions.  The bot's strategy focuses exclusively on the ADA/USDT pair, employing a live portfolio mode with a maximum of one trade per day.  The backtest, conversely, utilized a compounding portfolio mode over a much longer timeframe.  Further analysis of its quarterly reports will be necessary to understand the factors driving these differences and assess the long-term viability of the ADA Kicker strategy.


### 13. Quantom Trader

Quantom Trader demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 64 days yielded a modest 3.3% return, exceeding a market change of 16.74% with a respectable Sharpe Ratio of 1.24 and Calmar Ratio of 6.49, the backtest over 1158 days showed a substantial 379.44% return despite a negative market change of -11.34%.  This difference highlights potential overfitting in the backtesting data or a significant change in market conditions affecting the bot's live trading strategy.  The bot executes a relatively high number of trades (180 live, 3986 backtest), maintaining a consistent win rate above 60% in both scenarios, and a Profit/Loss ratio above 1.3.  It utilizes a portfolio equally weighted across 20 cryptocurrency pairs, with each trade capped at 20% of the portfolio.  The live bot expectation model indicates a high probability (100%) of positive returns in a 30-day period.  Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancy between the live and backtested results and optimize the bot for consistent performance.


### 14. stop take go

The crypto bot "stop take go" (bot_id: 024a02c3-fd73-48fb-9111-7ff3f45dbf17) exhibits a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 141 days yielded a 9.07% return, significantly outperforming the 28.11% market change with a respectable Sharpe Ratio of 1.06 and Calmar Ratio of 3.14, its backtest over a much longer period (1100 days) shows a substantially higher 211.57% return.  This suggests potential overfitting in the backtest or a significant shift in market conditions impacting live performance.  The backtest involved 2528 trades compared to only 86 in live trading.  Despite the difference in returns, both live and backtest data indicate a relatively low win rate (48.84% live, 57.04% backtest) compensated for by a favorable profit/loss ratio (1.68 live, 1.54 backtest). The bot utilizes a portfolio equally weighted across 15 crypto pairs, suggesting a diversified strategy.  Further investigation into the discrepancy between live and backtest results is warranted.


### 15. Linque

Linque is a crypto bot trading LINK/USDT that demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest over 1151 days yielded an impressive 474.5% return, significantly outperforming the market's -21.82% change, its live performance over 104 days shows a more modest 4.45% return against a 25.66% market increase.  Despite the lower live return, Linque maintains a respectable 61.5% win rate and a profit/loss ratio of 1.32 during live trading, suggesting consistent profitability albeit at a lower magnitude than indicated by the backtest.  The backtest showcases higher key performance indicators (KPIs) such as a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 and a Calmar ratio of 3.53, compared to 0.71 and 3.34 respectively during live trading. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of translating backtest results to real-market conditions, although the bot's positive live performance and relatively short average position duration (10:54:14) suggests potential for further refinement and optimization.


### 16. LINKADAWAX

The LINKADAWAX bot demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 107 days yielded a modest 8.55% return, exceeding a 16.99% market change with a Sharpe ratio of 0.75,  its backtest over 1100 days showed a substantial 554.2% return, outperforming a -19.43% market change and boasting a Sharpe ratio of 1.41.  Both live and backtest results indicate a consistent win rate around 64%, with a favorable profit/loss ratio (1.15 and 1.67 respectively). The bot trades ADA/USDT, LINK/USDT, and AVAX/USDT, exhibiting a relatively short average position duration (around 1 day) in both live and backtest scenarios.  However, the live performance's lower return and maximum drawdown (-15.5%) compared to the backtest (-35.46%) suggest potential overfitting or market condition differences influencing its live trading efficacy.  Further analysis is warranted to reconcile this disparity and assess the bot's long-term sustainability.


### 17. AI Quotient

The AI Quotient bot demonstrates a notable contrast between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest over 1158 days yielded a substantial 355.8% return despite a negative market change (-11.34%),  its live performance over 64 days shows a more modest 4.03% return,  against a positive market change of 16.74%.  Despite the difference in magnitude, both periods exhibit consistent characteristics: a win rate above 59%, a profit/loss ratio above 1.5, and a Sharpe ratio exceeding 1.5. The bot's live strategy, employing a portfolio equally weighted across 20 crypto pairs with a maximum trade size of 20%, aims for a 1% daily return, achieving a 30-day expected average return of 1.73%.  This suggests the bot may be more sensitive to short-term market fluctuations, needing longer time horizons to fully realize its backtested potential.  The backtest data suggests a more robust and potentially higher-risk strategy compared to the more conservative approach used in live trading.


### 18. Market Hacker

The "Market Hacker" bot (bot_id: 54fad580-404f-42cd-826d-49aea2fb6bf2) exhibits a notable discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance shows a modest 3.06% return over 64 days with a Sharpe ratio of 1.02 and a Calmar ratio of 6.03, indicating relatively good risk-adjusted returns despite a low win rate of 57.72%, the backtest reveals a significantly higher 374.55% return over a much longer period (1158 days).  This substantial difference highlights potential over-optimization in the backtesting or significant market shifts impacting live performance.  The bot utilizes a portfolio equally weighted across 20 crypto pairs, executing 149 trades live and over 4000 during the backtest period. Both live and backtest data show a Profit/Loss ratio consistently above 1, signifying that winning trades outweigh losing trades in terms of magnitude, a key characteristic that warrants further investigation into its trading strategy.  The consistently low average number of entries per trade suggests a simpler, perhaps less frequent approach to trading.


### 19. Cyber Bull

Cyber Bull exhibits a notable discrepancy between its live and backtest performances. While the backtest, spanning 1158 days, yielded a substantial 366.81% return despite a negative market change of -11.34%,  the live performance over 64 days shows a more modest 4.42% return against a 16.74% market increase.  This suggests potential overfitting in the backtest or significant market shifts affecting the bot's live trading strategy.  Both live and backtest data indicate a consistent profitability (Profit/Loss Ratio around 1.56-1.58) and a win rate above 58%, though higher in the backtest.  The bot employs a relatively short average position duration (around 1 day) and trades across a diverse portfolio of 20 crypto pairs equally weighted, contributing to its trading frequency (165 live trades vs 3858 backtest trades).  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the difference in live vs backtest performance.


### 20. Quant Xpert

Quant Xpert demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest, spanning 1158 days, yielded an impressive 356.36% return despite a negative market change (-11.34%), the live performance over 64 days shows a more modest 2.99% return against a positive market shift (16.74%).  Despite the lower live return, Quant Xpert maintains a respectable Sharpe Ratio (1.11) and Calmar Ratio (7.47), indicating reasonable risk-adjusted returns.  Its live win rate (57.53%) and profit/loss ratio (1.42) are consistent with its backtest figures (63.15% and 1.62 respectively), suggesting some degree of strategy robustness.  The bot employs a relatively high number of trades (146 live, 3628 backtest) across a diverse portfolio of 20 cryptocurrency pairs, each weighted equally.   Further investigation into the reasons for the difference in live versus backtest performance is recommended.


### 21. TstBot

TstBot ("5e3cd1d3-05b1-43a6-8665-ae2ea71da501") exhibits a stark contrast between its live and backtest performances.  Live performance, spanning 73 days, shows a positive 3.01% return, exceeding the market change of 5.33% with a respectable 71.43% win rate and a Sharpe Ratio of 0.45.  However, its backtest over a significantly longer period (1095 days) yielded a substantial -41.65% return despite a 69.62% win rate, highlighting a potential overfitting issue or significant market regime changes.  The live bot's average position duration (1 day 16 hours) is comparable to its backtest (1 day 10 hours). A maximum drawdown of -16.22% in live trading and a significantly worse -77.63% in backtesting further emphasizes this discrepancy.  While the live performance suggests short-term profitability, the backtest results raise concerns regarding the bot's robustness and long-term viability.  The bot utilizes a live portfolio mode and currently trades LINK/USDT.


### 22. Velocityx

Velocityx is a crypto bot trading XRP, ADA, DOGE, and ETC that demonstrates a notable discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While its live performance over 56 days yielded a modest 2.73% return, significantly underperforming the market's 22.07% change, its backtest over 1151 days showed a substantial 532.3% return.  Despite the lower live return, Velocityx exhibits promising risk-adjusted metrics with a Sharpe Ratio of 2.27 and a Calmar Ratio of 14.02, indicating strong risk management in live trading, although its maximum drawdown of -1.34% suggests room for improvement.  The backtest, though significantly more profitable, reveals a higher maximum drawdown (-13.85%) and longer recovery time (111 days), highlighting potential limitations of extrapolating backtest results to live market conditions. The bot's average position duration is relatively short (around 14 hours live, 10 hours backtest).  Its live 30-day return distribution suggests a 62.96% probability of achieving the desired 1% return.  This highlights a potential for improvement between the bot's expectation and its actual live performance.


### 23. ETCellent

ETCellent trading ETC/USDT demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance.  While the live performance yielded a modest 3.23% return over 105 days with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.13 and a Calmar Ratio of 7.5,  the backtest showcased a much higher 220.43% return over 1151 days, albeit with a considerably larger maximum drawdown (-13.6%). The backtest also boasts a higher win rate (78.42%) and Sharpe Ratio (1.63). This divergence highlights the challenges of translating backtested results to live market conditions.  Live trading exhibited a lower win rate (57.14%) and fewer trades (21 vs. 505), suggesting potential overfitting in the backtest or significant market shifts impacting live performance.  The bot's average position duration is relatively short in both live and backtest environments (approximately 13 and 10 hours respectively), indicating a potentially high-frequency trading strategy.  Despite the live performance being lower than the backtest, the consistently positive return probability (98.7%) and relatively low maximum drawdown (-1.53%) in live trading suggest a potentially resilient, albeit currently underperforming, strategy.


### 24. Peak and Trough Seeker

The Peak and Trough Seeker bot demonstrates a notable divergence between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest over a three-year period (2021-2024) yielded an impressive 46.29% return despite a significant maximum drawdown (-27.11%), the live performance over 33 days in 2025 shows a much more modest 1.41% return.  This discrepancy highlights the challenges of translating backtest success to real-market conditions.  The bot executed 117 trades live, achieving a 58.12% win rate and a 1.32 profit/loss ratio, suggesting consistent profitability on individual trades.  Conversely, the backtest involved 5492 trades with a slightly higher win rate (60.16%) but a lower profit/loss ratio (1.17).  The bot's live Sharpe ratio (1.53) and Calmar ratio (11.99) are significantly higher than its backtest counterparts (0.51 and 0.5 respectively), indicating superior risk-adjusted returns in the live environment.  The bot targets ten crypto pairs equally, suggesting a diversified strategy.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the difference between the backtested and live performance.


### 25. Bull Rush

Bull Rush is a crypto bot that displays contrasting performance characteristics between its live and backtest data.  While the backtest shows a significantly higher return of 150.78% over 1158 days, achieving a Sharpe Ratio of 1.71 and a Calmar Ratio of 3.24, its live performance over 64 days yielded a more modest 4.19% return.  This discrepancy highlights potential over-optimization in the backtest or a change in market conditions impacting the live strategy.  Despite the lower live return, Bull Rush executed 193 trades with a respectable 58.03% win rate and a profit/loss ratio of 1.3981.  Its live bot expectation model projects a 30-day average return of 1.06%, suggesting potential for consistent, albeit smaller, gains. The bot utilizes a live portfolio mode with equal allocation across 20 cryptocurrency pairs, indicating a diversified approach to risk management.  Further investigation into the divergence between backtest and live performance is recommended to refine the strategy.


### 26. OblivionSix

OblivionSix demonstrates a significant divergence between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 224.08% return over 1100 days, driven by 1064 trades with a 60.53% win rate and a 1.51 profit/loss ratio, its live performance over 21 days yielded a more modest 12.96% return from 28 trades.  This difference highlights the challenges of translating backtested results to the live market.  Despite the lower live return, OblivionSix exhibits strong risk-adjusted metrics with a Sharpe ratio of 4.59 and Calmar ratio of 108.7, suggesting efficient risk management.  Its relatively short average position duration of approximately 1 day and 12 hours in live trading, compared to 1 day and 8 hours during backtesting, suggests a potentially agile trading strategy.  The live bot's expectation of a 0.59% daily average return, however, indicates a lower-than-backtested potential in its current state.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the difference and optimize the bot for consistent performance.


### 27. Axiom Grow

Axiom Grow demonstrates a significant divergence between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest, spanning three years (2022-2025) and involving 658 trades, yielded a substantial 350.59% return, exceeding the market change of 39.22%, the live performance over 26 days showed a more modest 8.35% return, against a 13.78% market change.  Despite the lower live return, the bot exhibits positive characteristics including a Sharpe ratio of 3.42 and a Calmar ratio of 41.88, suggesting good risk-adjusted returns and low drawdown (-4.67%).  Its live performance is based on a portfolio concentrated in XRP, LINK, AVAX, and HBAR, with an average position duration of just over a day.  The backtest, conversely, showed a lower Sharpe ratio (1.46) and a higher maximum drawdown (-21.72%), but the longer timeframe and higher number of trades provide a broader perspective on its potential.  The disparity between live and backtest performance warrants further investigation to determine if this is due to market conditions, parameter optimization issues, or other factors.


### 28. CyberDoge

CyberDoge, bot ID , demonstrates contrasting performance profiles between its live and backtest periods.  Live performance, spanning 21 days, yielded a 6.25% return, exceeding the market change of 5.52% with a remarkable 100% win rate across only 4 trades.  This suggests a highly selective trading strategy, though the limited trade volume necessitates caution in interpreting the exceptionally high Sharpe (4.39) and Calmar (53.47) ratios. Backtesting over a significantly longer period (1100 days) reveals a much higher return of 183.15%, although this also significantly outperforms the market's 131.84% gain.  The backtest shows a more typical 85.71% win rate and a Profit/Loss ratio of 4.62, suggesting a robust strategy but also a higher maximum drawdown (-22.2%).  The discrepancy between live and backtest results highlights the inherent challenges of translating backtest performance into consistent live trading profits, particularly with a strategy as selective as CyberDoge's.  Further monitoring and analysis are crucial to assess its long-term viability.


### 29. PloarHedge

PloarHedge demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 509.97% return over 1100 days, with a consistent win rate (around 60%) and favorable profit/loss ratio (1.47),  live performance reveals a much more modest 3.35% return over 23 days. This difference highlights the challenges of translating backtest results to real-world trading conditions.  Despite the lower live return, PloarHedge maintains a respectable Sharpe Ratio of 5.56, suggesting relatively efficient risk-adjusted returns in live trading. Notably, the live bot exhibits a high maximum drawdown (-99.13%), indicating significant volatility, a characteristic that contrasts with the lower drawdown observed in backtesting (-24.34%).  The bot trades a diversified portfolio of 12 crypto pairs, executing a relatively high number of trades (68 live, 3616 backtest) with an average position duration of roughly one day.  Further investigation is warranted to understand the factors contributing to the divergence between backtest and live performance.


### 30. Motive6

Motive6 exhibits a stark contrast between its live and backtest performance.  While the live performance over 14 days yielded a modest 1.99% return, significantly outperforming the -7.34% market change with a strong Sharpe Ratio of 2.07 and Calmar Ratio of 18.19, its backtest over a considerably longer period (1100 days) showed a remarkable 270% return.  This disparity highlights the challenges of translating backtest success to live trading, though the live bot's positive Sharpe and Calmar ratios suggest promising risk-adjusted returns.  The backtest, while impressive, benefited from a substantially positive market trend (60.87% change).  Both live and backtest data reveal a relatively low number of trades (11 live, 883 backtest) and short average position durations (approximately 2 days).  The bot utilizes a portfolio primarily focused on ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, and LINK, with a live strategy targeting daily returns and a compound strategy during backtesting.  Despite the discrepancies, the consistent profit/loss ratios above 1.6 in both live and backtest data indicate the bot’s ability to generate profits on a trade-by-trade basis.


### 31. Porta Edge

Porta Edge (bot ID: 65d4ef07-b73d-43e5-ab83-aec780a9a9a0) demonstrates a significant divergence between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 26 days yielded a modest 3.72% return, exceeding a 5.54% market change with a respectable Sharpe ratio of 1.78 and Calmar ratio of 11.93, its backtest over three years shows a substantial 454.11% return against a 287.6% market change.  This discrepancy highlights potential overfitting in the backtest or a significant shift in market conditions.  Despite the difference in absolute returns, both live and backtest data indicate a consistent win rate around 58%, a favorable profit/loss ratio (1.44 live, 1.69 backtest), and an average position duration of approximately one day.  The bot's live strategy focuses on a portfolio of ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, SOL, DOGE, LINK, SUI, PEPE, AVAX, and HBAR, suggesting a preference for altcoins, and utilizes a maximum of 10 trades simultaneously.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile the disparity between the live and backtested results and to determine the robustness of the strategy in diverse market environments.


### 32. FlipForce

FlipForce is a crypto bot demonstrating contrasting performance between live and backtest environments.  While its backtest over 1100 days yielded an impressive 155.55% return, significantly outpacing the market's 56.68% change, its live performance over 21 days showed a more modest 3.04% return against a 5.65% market change. This discrepancy highlights the inherent risk in extrapolating backtest results to live trading.  Despite the lower live return, FlipForce executed 52 trades with a respectable 57.69% win rate and a 1.53 profit/loss ratio.  However, a substantial maximum drawdown of -98.94% in live trading underscores significant volatility and risk, a stark contrast to the -19.74% max drawdown observed in backtesting. The bot's average position duration is consistent across both environments (around 1 day and 7 hours), and it maintains a mean number of entries per trade of 1.0.  The live bot expectation model indicates a high potential for both significant gains and losses, which aligns with the observed live performance volatility.


### 33. Link Ops

The Link Ops bot exhibits a stark contrast between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance shows a modest 1.64% return over 3 days with only 2 trades and a 50% win rate,  its backtest demonstrates a significantly higher 549.76% return over 1151 days, involving 160 trades and a 69.375% win rate. This discrepancy highlights the inherent risk in extrapolating backtest results to live trading.  Despite the low number of live trades, Link Ops shows a promising 12.34 Sharpe Ratio, suggesting efficient risk-adjusted returns.  The backtest, while impressive, reveals a maximum drawdown of -18.99%, indicating periods of substantial losses despite the overall high profitability. The bot exclusively trades the LINK/USDT pair, utilizing a live portfolio mode and a compounding strategy in backtesting.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the differing performance and to assess the bot’s long-term viability and robustness.


### 34. Botlash

Botlash demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 364.94% return over 1100 days,  the live performance yielded a more modest 2.87% return over 21 days.  Both backtest and live trading exhibit similar win rates (around 60%), profit/loss ratios (approximately 1.4), and a mean number of entries of 1.0, suggesting consistency in trading strategy. However, the live performance is characterized by a dramatically higher maximum drawdown (-98.95%) compared to the backtest (-19.43%), highlighting significant risk in its live deployment.  The Sharpe and Calmar ratios also reflect this difference, with much higher values in backtesting (7.13 Sharpe, 0.57 Calmar live; 1.84 Sharpe, 3.42 Calmar backtest).  This discrepancy warrants further investigation to determine the factors contributing to the substantial difference in performance between the backtested and live environments.  The live bot's expectation of a 0.13% average daily return, contrasted with the backtest's 9.8% monthly return, further emphasizes this volatility.


### 35. Linque

Linque trading LINK/USDT demonstrates a significant divergence between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest, conducted over 1151 days, yielded a substantial 474.5% return with a strong Sharpe Ratio of 1.5 and Calmar Ratio of 3.53, the live performance over 15 days shows a -0.53% return, significantly underperforming the market (-2.58%). This discrepancy highlights potential issues with overfitting in the backtesting methodology or unanticipated market dynamics affecting the bot's live trading strategies.  Despite the poor live results, Linque executed only 4 trades, suggesting a potentially conservative approach, although its live win rate was a mediocre 50%. Further investigation is needed to reconcile the contrasting performances and improve the bot's live trading effectiveness.


### 36. FlipAxis

FlipAxis is a crypto bot that demonstrates a significant difference between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 310.64% return over 1100 days, with a notable Sharpe Ratio of 1.79 and a Calmar Ratio of 3.24, its live performance over 23 days yielded a more modest 2.82% return.  This discrepancy highlights the challenges of translating backtest results to real-world market conditions.  The live bot, however, maintains a respectable Sharpe Ratio of 6.96, suggesting consistent returns relative to risk despite the lower overall return. The significantly higher maximum drawdown (-98.95%) in live trading compared to backtesting (-18.46%) further underscores the volatility of live trading. FlipAxis employs a relatively high number of trades (69 live, 3250 backtest), and its average position duration is short (approximately one day in both live and backtest).  The bot's portfolio includes a diversified range of major cryptocurrencies, equally weighted, suggesting a strategy designed for broad market exposure.


### 37. Duality Capital

Duality Capital  exhibits a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 23 days yielded a modest 2.8% return despite a high Sharpe Ratio (5.55),  the backtest over 1100 days showed a substantial 281.07% return.  This difference highlights potential overfitting in the backtest or significant market shifts impacting the live strategy. Both live and backtest data indicate a similar profit/loss ratio (around 1.42-1.44) and win rate (around 60%), suggesting consistency in trade selection despite the vastly different returns. The live bot's extremely high maximum drawdown (-98.93%) is a serious concern, contrasting sharply with the much smaller drawdown (-11.88%) in the backtest. This underscores a need for further analysis to understand the risk management aspects of the live strategy and improve its robustness.  The bot trades across 12 major crypto pairs simultaneously, holding positions for approximately one day on average.  Live bot expectations suggest a low average daily return but a reasonably high probability (43.48%) of a positive daily return.


### 38. Duovex

Duovex is a crypto bot exhibiting contrasting performance between its live and backtest results.  While the live performance over 23 days showed a modest 2.74% return, significantly impacted by a -98.94% maximum drawdown, the backtest over 1100 days achieved a substantial 341.84% return with a much more manageable -14.64% maximum drawdown.  Despite a similar win rate (around 60%) and Profit/Loss ratio (approximately 1.4) in both live and backtest, the live bot's Sharpe and Calmar ratios are considerably higher (5.55 and 0.51 respectively) compared to the backtest (1.97 and 4.35).  This suggests that although the backtest indicates high potential, the live bot's performance has been volatile, necessitating further analysis to understand the discrepancy and potentially improve risk management. The bot trades across 12 pairs simultaneously, with an average position duration of roughly one day.  Its live 1-day return distribution shows a relatively low probability of achieving the desired return, highlighting the need for refined strategies to mitigate risk and improve consistency.


### 39. Equilibra

Equilibra is a crypto bot  exhibiting a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest shows a robust 170.84% return over 1100 days, with a commendable 61.2% win rate and Sharpe Ratio of 1.18, live performance yielded a much more modest 2.61% return over 21 days, albeit with a respectable Sharpe Ratio of 5.68.  This difference highlights potential overfitting in the backtest or unforeseen market conditions impacting live trading.  Equilibra executes a relatively small number of trades in live mode (48) compared to its backtest (2093), suggesting a potentially more cautious or less frequent approach during live operation. Despite a substantial maximum drawdown (-98.94%) in live trading, the bot's relatively short average position duration (1 day 7 minutes) and a quick maximum recovery time of 11 days suggests a potentially adaptive strategy. Further investigation is needed to reconcile the differing performance metrics and determine the reasons behind the disparity.


### 40. Magma Trader

Magma Trader exhibits a stark contrast between its live and backtest performance.  While the live performance over 24 days yielded a modest 2.69% return, significantly outperforming the market's 4.99% change with a robust Sharpe Ratio of 5.82 and a Calmar Ratio of 56.96, indicating low risk relative to return.  This strong live performance is achieved with a high win rate (93.75%) across only 16 trades.  In contrast, the backtest over 1094 days shows a much higher return of 128.29%, but with considerably higher volatility reflected in a Sharpe Ratio of only 0.9 and a substantial maximum drawdown of -25.76%.  The backtest involved 738 trades, suggesting a different trading style or market conditions compared to the live run.  Magma Trader's live bot expectation reveals an expected average daily return of 0.1119%,  a fairly conservative strategy,  while the backtest expectation suggests higher returns over longer periods (30 day average: 3.4204%). The discrepancy highlights the challenges of translating backtest results into consistent live performance, though the positive live results remain encouraging.


### 41. Legacy Portfolio

The Legacy Portfolio bot demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 368.81% return over 1100 days, driven by 2179 trades and a strong Profit/Loss ratio of 1.66, live performance yielded a more modest 2.64% return over 26 days with 59 trades.  Despite the lower live return, the bot maintains a respectable Sharpe Ratio of 1.23 and a high Calmar Ratio of 8.37, indicating good risk-adjusted returns.  Its live win rate (59.32%) is comparable to its backtest win rate (58.33%), suggesting some consistency in trading strategy.  However, the substantial difference in overall returns highlights the challenges of translating backtest results to live market conditions. The bot's portfolio, actively trading 13 cryptocurrency pairs, uses a live portfolio mode and aims for a daily return around 0.05%.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the performance divergence.


### 42. Fusion Port

Fusion Port  demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest, spanning 1100 days, yielded a remarkable 336.35% return, the live performance over 26 days shows a more modest 2.49% return.  This difference highlights the challenges of translating backtest results to real-world market conditions.  Despite the lower live return, Fusion Port exhibits a respectable Sharpe Ratio of 1.23 and a high Calmar Ratio of 7.44, suggesting relatively low risk compared to market returns (6.35%).  The bot's live strategy involves 62 trades across 13 cryptocurrency pairs (excluding BTC and SHIB), achieving a 59.68% win rate with a profit/loss ratio of 1.28. The backtest, conversely, utilized a compounding strategy across a similar set of pairs, resulting in 2301 trades with a slightly lower win rate (58.15%) but a higher profit/loss ratio (1.63). Both live and backtest data indicate an average position duration of approximately one day, suggesting a relatively active trading style.  Further investigation is needed to understand the divergence between backtest and live results and to assess the bot's long-term viability.


### 43. Stop Take Go

The "Stop Take Go" bot  demonstrates a significant divergence between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest, spanning 1100 days, yielded an impressive 211.57% return despite a relatively low time-in-market (67.33%),  live performance over 26 days shows a more modest 2.23% return.  Both live and backtest data indicate a similar win rate (around 57%), suggesting a consistent trading strategy. However, the live bot's Sharpe and Calmar ratios (1.29 and 8.71 respectively) suggest a lower risk-adjusted return compared to the backtest (1.42 and 2.48). The maximum drawdown was considerably higher in the backtest (-18.48%) than in the live run (-3.98%), highlighting the challenges of translating backtest results to real-market conditions.  The bot trades across 15 cryptocurrency pairs with equal weighting in a live portfolio and uses a relatively short average position duration of approximately one day.


### 44. Short Flow

The "Short Flow" bot  exhibits a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance.  While the live performance over 26 days yielded a modest 1.96% return with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.61 and a Calmar Ratio of 12.6,  indicating reasonable risk-adjusted returns despite a relatively low win rate (43.14%), its backtest over 1280 days shows a considerably higher 140.52% return. This divergence suggests potential issues with overfitting in the backtesting data or a change in market conditions since the backtest period (2021-2025).  The bot utilizes a portfolio of eight major crypto pairs (ETH/USDT, XRP/USDT, etc.) equally, executing 51 trades live versus 1730 in the backtest.  Despite the difference in performance, both live and backtest data consistently show an average position duration under a day and a Profit/Loss ratio above 1, indicating a profitable trading strategy when successful.  Further investigation into the reasons for the performance gap between live and backtest is recommended.


### 45. HedgeX

HedgeX demonstrates a notable contrast between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance yielded a modest 1.63% return over 23 days with 47 trades and a 57.45% win rate,  its backtest showcased a significantly higher 365.1% return over a much longer period (1100 days) involving 1984 trades.  Despite a slightly lower win rate (59.02%) in the backtest, the Profit/Loss ratio was considerably better (1.686 vs 1.1962).  Live trading exhibited a Sharpe ratio of 0.89 and a Calmar ratio of 5.6, indicating reasonable risk-adjusted returns and drawdown management compared to the market change of 3.23%.  The backtest, however, although displaying impressive returns, also suffered from a more substantial maximum drawdown (-21.53%) compared to its live counterpart (-4.75%).  The average position duration remained relatively consistent between live (1 day 09:06:23) and backtest (1 day 06:48:53), suggesting a similar trading strategy. The discrepancy between live and backtest performance warrants further investigation into potential factors influencing live trading results.


### 46. ScalperX

ScalperX is a high-frequency trading bot exhibiting contrasting performance between live and backtest data.  While its live performance over 64 days yielded a modest 1.82% return, significantly underperforming the 16.74% market change, its backtest over a much longer period (1158 days) shows a substantial 330.01% return despite a negative (-11.34%) market shift. This discrepancy highlights potential issues with overfitting or market regime changes not captured in the backtest.  ScalperX executes a relatively high number of trades (154 live, 3664 backtest) with average position durations around 1 day, indicating a short-term, scalping strategy.  Live win rate is 57.14%, while the backtest boasts a higher 63.56% win rate.  Both live and backtest exhibit favorable profit/loss ratios (1.21 and 1.59 respectively) and Calmar ratios (2.19 and 2.89 respectively), suggesting some risk management effectiveness, though the live Sharpe ratio (0.46) is considerably lower than its backtest counterpart (1.76).  The live bot's 30-day return distribution indicates a 52.78% probability of positive returns, which while not exceptionally high, contrasts with the significantly higher positive return probability (82.20%) predicted by its backtest distribution.  Further investigation into the differences between live and backtested results is warranted.


### 47. STX Flow

STX Flow exhibits a notable discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 23 days yielded a modest 1.36% return, significantly underperforming the market change of 3.73%, the backtest over a substantially longer period (1100 days) showed a remarkable 281.68% return.  Despite the live win rate (55.81%) being slightly lower than the backtest (58.77%),  the Profit/Loss ratio is relatively consistent across both (1.17 live vs 1.59 backtest).  The live bot's Sharpe ratio (0.75) and Calmar ratio (5.05) indicate acceptable risk-adjusted returns, while backtest results show higher Sharpe (1.41) and Calmar (2.64) ratios, hinting at a potential overfitting or market condition differences.  The significantly shorter average position duration in live trading (1 day 12 hours) compared to backtesting (1 day 9 hours 53 minutes) suggests a faster-paced, potentially more reactive trading strategy in live mode.  The live bot's expectation model suggests a low average daily return (0.0514%), highlighting the need for further optimization to better align live and backtest performance.


### 48. Heimdall

Heimdall is a crypto bot that demonstrates contrasting performance characteristics between its live and backtest data.  While the live performance, covering a recent 7-day period, shows a modest 0.34% return with only two trades and a perfect 100% win rate, its backtest over a significantly longer period (729 days) yielded a much higher 54.21% return, despite a negative market change of -34.58%. The backtest involved substantially more trades (714) and a 90.62% win rate, suggesting a robust strategy capable of outperforming the market.  Live data exhibits a very high Sharpe Ratio (7.36) and no drawdown, indicating very low risk in the short term. The backtest data, however, shows a more typical Sharpe Ratio of 1.08 and a maximum drawdown of -11.54%, providing a more realistic representation of potential risk in longer-term performance.  The stark difference underscores the inherent limitations of extrapolating backtest results to live trading conditions and highlights the need for further observation of Heimdall's live performance.


### 49. Stable Flow

Stable Flow exhibits a notable discrepancy between its live and backtest performances. While the backtest over 1280 days showed a substantial 91.71% return, significantly outperforming the market's 71.51% change,  the live performance over 20 days yielded a more modest 1.02% return against a -3.19% market shift.  This difference might indicate sensitivity to market conditions not fully captured in the backtest. Despite the lower live return, Stable Flow maintains a respectable Sharpe Ratio (1.55 live, 1.14 backtest) and Calmar Ratio (9.28 live, 2.6 backtest), suggesting consistent risk-adjusted returns, though the live data is limited.  The bot's live win rate (66.67%) is slightly lower than its backtested win rate (72.16%), but the Profit/Loss ratio remains positive in both (1.49 live, 2.42 backtest), showcasing its ability to generate profit even with losses.  The bot trades across eight major cryptocurrency pairs with a relatively low number of trades (6 live, 255 backtest), suggesting a potentially less frequent, higher impact trading strategy.


### 50. VelocityX

VelocityX demonstrates a significant disparity between its backtest and live performance. While the backtest, conducted over 1151 days, yielded an impressive 532.3% return with a Sharpe Ratio of 2.66 and a Calmar Ratio of 5.73, its live performance over 12 days shows a much more modest 0.42% return.  This difference highlights the inherent risk in extrapolating backtest results to live trading conditions.  Despite the lower live return, VelocityX exhibits a relatively high Calmar Ratio (8.98) suggesting strong risk-adjusted returns despite its limited live trading history, and a reasonable Sharpe Ratio (0.7).  The bot's strategy, focusing on XRP, ADA, DOGE, and ETC pairs, targets a daily expected return, and its relatively short average position duration (0 days 15:09:33 live, 0 days 10:15:25 backtest) indicates a potentially active, short-term trading approach. Further live data is needed to fully assess its long-term viability and consistency.


### 51. Spot Master

Spot Master demonstrates a notable discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 465.5% return over 1100 days,  achieving a Sharpe Ratio of 1.7 and Calmar Ratio of 3.24, the live performance yielded a more modest 0.89% return over 24 days. This difference highlights the challenges of translating backtested results to real-world trading conditions.  Despite the lower live return, Spot Master executed 55 trades with a win rate of 56.36%, suggesting a consistent trading strategy, although its Sharpe ratio (0.42) and maximum drawdown (-6.02%) indicate some volatility.  The bot's live strategy focuses on a portfolio primarily composed of ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, SOL, DOGE, LINK, SUI, PEPE, TRX, AVAX, TON, and HBAR, with a daily expected average return of 0.0318%, compared to 12.0333% in the backtest. The average position duration of roughly one day indicates a short-term, potentially scalping, approach.  Further investigation is needed to understand the factors contributing to the divergence between backtested and live performance.


### 52. Bull Sense

Bull Sense demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 121.06% return over 1151 days, with a strong Sharpe ratio of 1.43 and a Calmar ratio of 2.44, its live performance yielded a much more modest 0.33% return over 23 days.  This difference highlights the challenges of translating backtested results to real-world market conditions.  The live bot executed 77 trades with a 51.95% win rate and a Profit/Loss ratio slightly above 1, suggesting some consistency despite the low overall return.  Its live bot expectation model indicates a positive return probability of 45.83%, with a limited average daily expected return (0.0203%).  Conversely, the backtest model demonstrates higher expected average returns (3.3368%) and a substantially higher positive return probability (82.71%).  Further investigation into the differences between the backtest and live trading parameters (e.g., portfolio mode, max trade size) and market conditions would be necessary to fully explain this performance divergence.


### 53. Arcadia3

Arcadia3 demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance.  While the backtest, spanning 1100 days, yielded an impressive 506.71% return despite a negative market change of -19.43%, showcasing a strong Sharpe Ratio (1.61) and Calmar Ratio (3.43), its live performance over 19 days is considerably more modest at 0.38%. This lower live return is attributed to a lower win rate (53.85% vs 65.46%) and profit/loss ratio (1.06 vs 1.80) compared to its backtest.  The bot trades ADA/USDT, LINK/USDT, and AVAX/USDT, with an average position duration of approximately 1 day, and employs a live portfolio mode focusing primarily on ADA and LINK.  Despite the divergence between live and backtest results, the backtest data suggests a potentially robust strategy that may require further optimization or refinement for consistent live performance.


### 54. Profitologist

The Profitologist bot exhibits a stark contrast between its live and backtest performance.  While the live performance over 14 days yielded a modest 0.16% return from a single trade (100% win rate), its backtest over a significantly longer period (1094 days) showcased a much more impressive 77.33% return from 210 trades (93.33% win rate). This discrepancy highlights the inherent risk in extrapolating backtest results to live trading.  The backtest data reveals a healthy Profit/Loss ratio of 5.095 and a Sharpe Ratio of 0.99, suggesting reasonable risk-adjusted returns.  However, the live bot's Sharpe Ratio of -2.5 and a maximum drawdown of 0% in the short observation period need further evaluation.  Profitologist employs a portfolio strategy equally weighted across 16 major cryptocurrency pairs, making its performance potentially less dependent on any single asset's volatility.  Further monitoring of live performance is crucial to assess the bot's long-term viability and to understand the factors contributing to the significant difference between backtested and live results.


### 55. Money Lover

The "Money Lover" bot exhibits a stark contrast between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest, conducted over 1094 days, showcased a substantial 141.01% return with a high win rate (76.5%) and favorable profit/loss ratio (2.68), the live performance over 18 days yielded a much more modest 0.15% return,  a 50% win rate, and a Sharpe ratio of -0.41, indicating underperformance relative to risk. This discrepancy suggests potential overfitting in the backtesting phase or significant market shifts affecting the bot's live strategy.  The bot utilizes a portfolio encompassing 14 crypto pairs with equal weighting (excluding TON and DOT), averaging around 12 days per position. The live bot expectation shows a low average daily return of 0.0082% but indicates the possibility of a maximum daily return of 0.5179%, suggesting potential for higher returns despite current underperformance.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile the differences and optimize the bot's live trading strategy.


### 56. Market Scout

Market Scout demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the live performance over 6 days yielded a modest 0.08% return from a single trade (100% win rate), its backtest over a full year (2022-2023) showed a substantial 38.26% return across 788 trades, achieving an 82.23% win rate and a profit/loss ratio of 1.54.  Despite the stark contrast in returns, both live and backtest data indicate a relatively low time in market (approximately 27%), suggesting a strategic approach focused on selective trades.  The backtest exhibits a positive Sharpe ratio (1.51) and a moderate Calmar ratio (3.31), indicating reasonable risk-adjusted returns, while the live Sharpe ratio (-1.75) is negative.  The live bot's expectation model, based on 1-day returns, anticipates a low average return, highlighting the need for further optimization or a reevaluation of its current live trading parameters given the large difference compared to the backtest.


### 57. Quantify

The Quantify bot demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 254.87% return over 1151 days, driven by a 64.65% win rate and a 1.61 profit/loss ratio, its live performance yielded a much more modest 0.19% return over 23 days. This disparity might be attributed to several factors, including over-optimization during backtesting, market regime changes, or slippage during execution.  Despite the lower live return, Quantify maintains a reasonable 57.65% win rate in live trading and a relatively short average position duration (around 11 hours). The bot's live quarterly reports show fluctuating returns, indicating sensitivity to market conditions, with some periods exhibiting strong positive returns and others experiencing significant losses.  Further investigation into the causes of the live/backtest divergence is recommended.

### 82. ADAlytics 

The ADAlytics bot exhibits a stark contrast between its backtest and live performance.  While the backtest, conducted over 1100 days, showcased a remarkable 306.51% return with a strong Sharpe Ratio of 1.45 and Calmar Ratio of 2.15,  the live performance over 19 days reveals a negative 0.43% return,  a significantly lower win rate (66.67% vs 74.31%), and poor Sharpe (-0.46) and Calmar (-1.16) ratios. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of translating backtest success to real-market conditions.  ADAlytics trades ADA/USDT pairs, employing a live portfolio mode with a relatively low time in market (63.91% live, 30.29% backtest), and an average position duration of approximately 4 days. While the backtest involved a substantial number of trades (253), the live data is limited to only 3 trades, suggesting a need for more robust live data to draw definitive conclusions about its long-term profitability.  The live bot expectation model indicates a low average return but a reasonable 45% probability of a positive daily return.


### 83. XRPi

XRPi, trading XRP/USDT, exhibits a stark contrast between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest over 1151 days yielded an impressive 842.07% return, significantly outperforming the market's 174.57% change, the live performance over 17 days shows a -2.43% return, underperforming a market increase of 4.81%.  This discrepancy suggests potential overfitting in the backtest or significant market shifts affecting live trading.  The backtest boasts a high win rate (68.41%) and profit/loss ratio (1.8978), while the live bot struggles with a low win rate (40%) and a profit/loss ratio of only 0.6268.  Further investigation is needed to determine the causes of this performance divergence and to assess whether the live bot's expectation of a -0.0479% average daily return is achievable given the current market conditions.


### 84. Profit Sniper

Profit Sniper demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a remarkable 341.26% return over 1158 days, characterized by a high Sharpe ratio (1.7) and Calmar ratio (2.97),  live performance yielded a more modest 0.86% return over 64 days.  This difference highlights potential overfitting in the backtest or market shifts impacting the strategy's effectiveness in real-time.  Despite the lower live return, Profit Sniper executed 152 trades with a 57.24% win rate and a 1.11 profit/loss ratio, suggesting a relatively consistent, albeit less spectacular, approach. The bot's live quarterly reports show fluctuating performance, indicating sensitivity to market conditions.  Its portfolio utilizes an equal weighting across 20 major crypto pairs, with a maximum trade size of 20%. The backtest's longer timeframe reveals a maximum drawdown of -20.06%, while the live performance had a significantly smaller maximum drawdown of -4.66%.  This suggests the bot's risk management may be functioning effectively in live trading despite the difference in overall returns.


### 85. AutoNest3

AutoNest3 demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a robust 344.94% return over 1100 days,  a 65.37% win rate, and favorable Sharpe (1.35) and Calmar (2.55) ratios, its live performance over 20 days yielded a negative 2.15% return.  This stark contrast suggests potential overfitting in the backtest or unforeseen market conditions impacting the live strategy.  The live bot trades ADA/USDT, LINK/USDT, and AVAX/USDT, with a 57.14% win rate and a Profit/Loss ratio near parity (0.90), indicating a need for improvement in risk management and trade selection. The live bot's short average position duration (1 day 16 hours) contrasts with its backtest average (1 day 8 hours). Despite the negative live return, the live_bot_expectation suggests a potential for improvement given an expected average daily return of -0.13% and  a 42.86% probability of positive returns.


### 86. Link Think

The crypto bot "Link Think" trading LINK/USDT shows a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest, conducted over 1151 days, yielded a remarkable 221.96% return despite a negative market change of -21.82%, the live performance over 17 days resulted in a -4.56% return with a positive market change of 8.36%. This stark contrast highlights a potential overfitting issue in the backtest or unforeseen market conditions affecting live trading.  The bot executed only 3 trades live, resulting in a low win rate (33.33%) and a poor Sharpe ratio (-4.65), indicating high risk relative to return.  Backtesting, however, revealed a much higher win rate (68.44%) and a positive Sharpe ratio (1.46), suggesting a potentially profitable strategy if the overfitting issue can be addressed.  The average position duration is relatively short in both live (0 days 11:55:00) and backtest (0 days 09:55:56) scenarios.


### 87. Algo Dragon

Algo Dragon demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its backtest and live performance.  While the backtest, conducted over 1151 days, yielded an impressive 174.89% return with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.41 and a Calmar Ratio of 2.35,  its live performance over 21 days shows a negative return of -3.68%. This stark contrast highlights the challenges of translating backtest success into consistent live trading profits.  The live bot executed 74 trades with a 52.7% win rate and a Profit/Loss ratio of 0.67, indicating a need for improved risk management or strategy adjustments.  Despite the negative live performance, Algo Dragon’s backtest data suggests potential, exhibiting a higher win rate (57.6%) and a much more favorable Profit/Loss ratio (1.48).  Further analysis is required to determine the root causes of this performance divergence and to optimize the bot's strategy for consistent profitability in live markets.


### 88. Intelivest

Intelivest demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 533.29% return over 1100 days, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.9 and a Calmar ratio of 3.47,  live performance reveals a negative 4.48% return over 20 days, characterized by a low win rate (48.84%) and a Sharpe ratio of -2.47.  This contrast highlights potential overfitting in the backtesting model or significant market shifts impacting the bot's live trading strategy.  Despite a relatively high number of trades (43) in the live environment, its average position duration (1 day 23:04:11) suggests a shorter-term strategy compared to its backtest (1 day 04:44:31). The live bot expectation indicates a low average daily return (-0.2437%), and while it targets a 45% probability of positive returns, the actual performance thus far falls short of expectations.  A deeper investigation into the divergence between backtest and live performance is needed to assess the bot's overall viability and robustness.


### 89. ZeusTrade

ZeusTrade exhibits a stark contrast between its backtest and live performance.  While the backtest, run over 1151 days, yielded an impressive 348.18% return with a 57.58% win rate and a Profit/Loss ratio of 1.48, the live performance over 18 days shows a -7.43% return, a significantly lower 52.31% win rate, and a much reduced Profit/Loss ratio of 0.6.  This discrepancy highlights potential overfitting in the backtesting strategy or unforeseen market conditions impacting the live trading. Notably, the live bot experienced a massive -99.53% maximum drawdown,  a critical indicator of significant risk. Although the Sharpe ratio (6.33) suggests good risk-adjusted returns in live trading, the negative Calmar ratio (-0.78) and extremely high maximum drawdown raise serious concerns about its robustness.  The bot trades across 15 pairs with equal weight in its live portfolio, executing 65 trades during the reported period.  Further investigation into the divergence between backtest and live performance is recommended.


### 90. MarketNav

MarketNav demonstrates a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 192.49% return over 1158 days, characterized by a strong Sharpe Ratio (2.23) and Calmar Ratio (5.41),  the live performance yielded a much more modest 0.15% return over 109 days.  This discrepancy highlights potential issues with over-optimization in the backtest or market conditions differing significantly from those during the backtest period.  Despite the lower live return, MarketNav maintains a respectable 66.67% win rate with 105 trades, suggesting a potentially viable strategy that requires further refinement to align live performance with backtested expectations. The bot's live quarterly reports show volatility in returns across different periods and reliance on a portfolio of 10 cryptocurrency pairs, notably ETH, XRP, and DOGE.


### 91. Adara

Adara, demonstrates a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance on the ADA/USDT pair.  While the backtest over 1151 days yielded a substantial 260.02% return with a 67.53% win rate and a favorable profit/loss ratio of 2.99, its live performance over a much shorter period (2 days, 21 hours, 30 minutes) resulted in a -3.19% loss and a 0% win rate. This stark contrast suggests potential overfitting in the backtesting data or significant market shifts impacting the bot's live trading strategy.  The live bot expectation model shows a high probability of negative returns (-1.06% average), while the backtest model projects a positive average return of 6.91%. This difference highlights the need for further analysis and potential adjustments to Adara's parameters to improve its live trading efficacy and better match its backtested results.


### 92. Level Explorer

The Level Explorer bot exhibits a significant disparity between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest demonstrates a substantial 112.58% return over 1095 days, involving 3546 trades with a 59.33% win rate and favorable profit/loss ratio (1.4194), its live performance from July 4th, 2025 to August 6th, 2025 shows a negative 2.39% return across 173 trades and a lower 51.44% win rate.  This divergence highlights a potential over-optimization in the backtesting phase or a failure to adapt to changing market conditions.  The bot's live performance, however, indicates a relatively short average position duration (8 minutes) and trades across ten major crypto pairs with equal weighting, suggesting a potentially high-frequency, diversified trading strategy. Further investigation into the reasons for the performance discrepancy is warranted.


### 93. spot master

The "spot master" bot exhibits a significant discrepancy between its live and backtest performance. While the backtest shows a substantial 465.5% return over 1100 days, characterized by a strong Sharpe Ratio of 1.7 and a Calmar Ratio of 3.24, the live performance reveals a negative 7.71% return across 141 days.  This stark contrast highlights a potential overfitting issue in the backtest or significant market shifts not captured in the historical data.  Despite a relatively high time in market (76.04% live, 66.63% backtest), the live bot's win rate (39.47%) and profit/loss ratio (0.66) are considerably lower than its backtested counterparts (58.33% and 1.65 respectively).  The live bot's average position duration (3 days) is longer than the backtest (1 day), suggesting a potential difference in trading strategy execution.  Further investigation into the discrepancy between live and backtested results is necessary to assess the bot's true effectiveness and to identify potential areas for improvement.
